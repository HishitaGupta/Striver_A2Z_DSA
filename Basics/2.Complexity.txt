*Time Complexity != Time taken
                    because the time taken by code to run depends on the configuration of machine like hupothetically mackbook may take lesser time than windows to run a program.

*Definition =  Rate at which time taken increses with increase in input size

*Complexity - in terms of Big (O) Notation - O(Time taken or no. of steps)
            - in terms of worst case scenario - (calculate grade example)
            - ignore the constants - whenever input size is very large constant dont hold any significance 
                -(4N^3 + 5N^2 + 1) if N= 10^5 then adding 1 makes no difference to already large number
            - ignore the lower values


*Cases - BestCase, WorstCase, AverageCase

*Other Notations - Big Oh Notation - worst case - upper bound
                - Theta  Notation - average case
                - Omega Notation - lowest bound


***Space Complexity - memory space your program takes
                    - auxillary space  + input space
                    -(space taken to solve the program) + (space taken to store the program)
                    - input a,b  - a,b -input space
                    - c = a+b - c - auxillary space
