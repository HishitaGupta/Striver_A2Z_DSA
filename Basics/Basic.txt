***Difference between "/n" and endl

"\n" -> Functionality -  slower
                         newline character
        Performance - faster
        Buffer Handling - No

endl -> Functionality - faster
                        manipulator
                        inserts a new line
                        flushes the output buffer (forces all buffered output to be displayed immediately)
        Performance -   slower (perform newline as well as buffer operation)
        Buffer Handling - Yes,(buffer flush operation can be expensive, especially in programs with frequent output operations.)

***use <bits/stdc++.h> - to include all libraries at once takes negligible time in comparison time taken to run a program

***DataTypes
int,long int,long long int -> int values 
float,double ,long double->decimal values
str->takes word before space (for full line use getline(cin,str))


****Range of DataTypes
int - 4 bytes - (-2^(32)/2)-1 to (2^(32)/2)-1 

***2d array
arr [3][5]-> 3 times 5 column array , row-col

***String also stores every character in terms of array indexs

***Functions - void , return , parameterised , non-parameterised
